        <p>The <em>Zhiraff</em> is awesome because <strong>The giraffe is a record holder in the animal world in terms of height and is one of the largest animals. The growth of the giraffe reaches a height of up to 6 meters. At the same time, the giraffe's weight is 1 ton.The giraffe's 1/3 height is its neck, which is unusually long and slender, the giraffe's heart weighs 12 kg and passes 60 liters of blood per minute, creating a pressure 3 times higher than that of a human. As well as its color , the dark spots that are on its body are unique , as is the human imprint .</strong>.</p>
